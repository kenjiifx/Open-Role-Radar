# OpenRoleRadar

First-party early-career roles (internships, co-ops, new grad) scraped from public employer ATS boards and published as a searchable static site.

[![CI](https://github.com/moosacodes/Open-Role-Radar/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/moosacodes/Open-Role-Radar/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Sync](https://github.com/moosacodes/Open-Role-Radar/actions/workflows/sync-fast.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/moosacodes/Open-Role-Radar/actions/workflows/sync-fast.yml)

**Live:** https://moosacodes.github.io/Open-Role-Radar/

## What it does

- Polls **public** Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workday, Workable, and SmartRecruiters boards on a GitHub Actions schedule
- **Fast path every 5 minutes**: parallel Greenhouse / Lever / Ashby polls (the same public ATS JSON APIs Simplify scrapes), plus their GitHub listings dump as a discovery signal that auto-promotes new boards into our direct poll list
- Classifies early-career titles (intern / co-op / new-grad / junior / engineer I / campus, plus ATS metadata tags)
- Exports static JSON + Atom feeds; browser refresh reads a live-feed branch so Pages CDN lag doesn’t hide new syncs

## What it does not do

- Scrape LinkedIn or Indeed (aggregator noise; we only use first-party apply URLs)
- Depend on SWE List as a data source — SWE List itself just polls SimplifyJobs GitHub JSON; we hit the underlying ATS boards directly and refresh more often than their ~30m dump
- Cover every employer on earth — boards still need a public API we can poll
- Guarantee sub-minute latency — GitHub Actions schedules bottom out around 5 minutes
